          Hello! My name is <strong>Ibrahim Ideis</strong>, and this project is my final submission for the <em>Web Programming</em> course. This application, the <strong>Adorable Pet Game üêæ</strong>, is designed to showcase the skills and concepts I have learned throughout this course, including frontend development with Next.js, TailwindCSS, and user interaction handling.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 max-w-3xl mx-auto leading-relaxed mt-4">
          I aimed to create an engaging and interactive platform for users to enjoy while applying key web development principles. I hope you find this project as fun and rewarding to use as it was for me to build. Thank you for visiting, and I appreciate your support!
